Trouleshooting during learning and Notes

1) While we use normal Java project and add Selenium and chromeDriver jar manually we need to set system property as below mentioned in our test file
	System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "C:\\path\\of\\chromedriver\\chromedriver.exe");
	
	But when we use mave project we need to install WebDriverManager Dependency in pom.xml file and use below code in our test file
	WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
	
2) While using maven project we need to set goal as "clean install" while building maver project

3) To run all the testcase we can also use terminal navigate to project directory and run command "mvn clean test"
